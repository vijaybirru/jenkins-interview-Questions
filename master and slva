3.of executors: The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this agent. 
I have used 1 executor for testing purpose, but a good practice would be the number of CPU cores on the machine.

Remote root directory: An agent needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. 
Specify the path to this directory on the agent. Iâ€™ve specified /home/ec2-user/jenkins as the remote root directory.

Labels: Labels are used to group multiple agents into one logical group. Multiple labels must be separated by a space.
