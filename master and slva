1.which plugins u use mostly?

2.Note : In case if not taking into switch user then please try to modify the below line in ""/etc/passwd ""
bash-4.2$ sudo cat /etc/passwd
jenkins:x:996:994:Jenkins Automation Server:/var/lib/jenkins:/bin/false

Here just replace with "false" to "bash" then save it and exit "/etc/passwd"

Then after try to switch the user "jenkins "
[root@ip-10-0-2-83 ec2-user]# su jenkins
bash-4.2$

3.of executors: The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this agent. 
I have used 1 executor for testing purpose, but a good practice would be the number of CPU cores on the machine.

Remote root directory: An agent needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. 
Specify the path to this directory on the agent. I’ve specified /home/ec2-user/jenkins as the remote root directory.

Labels: Labels are used to group multiple agents into one logical group. Multiple labels must be separated by a space.

&&&&&&&&&Integration between jenkins and github&&&&&&&&&&
Option a)
Go to Github account repo name of Organization: "staticwebsites"  -->> settings ----> click on "integrate and service" --> search "Jenkins(Github) ---> click on "addservice"
then you can go ahead for creating github account repo in jenkins jobs as below example

(or)

Option b)
Go to Github Organization -->> "Settings" --> click on "webhooks"--->> again click on "Add Webhook" and confirm "Password"-->then
Under "Payload URL" -->>give the your Jenkins URL: Ex: http://34.217.27.129:8080/github-webhook/ ---> click on "Add Webhook"-->Try to see the respne "200" success once you're added the url for load the jenkins url

Jobs:
1)simple echo jobs
2)review logs
3)Statiwebite job running on jenkins mater
4)staticwebsite CI jobs integrating with github and jenkins

Note:For online notes
select the options to trigger "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" under "Build Environment"
On the v1.25.1 release of the GitHub plugin, trigger Build when a change is pushed to GitHub has been renamed to GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling."

**********Migrating jobs from existing old jenkins to other jenkins server**************
3 ways 
1:One is copying the jobs directories from exising jenkins(/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/sample-job) to new jenkins server(/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/sample-job-new) jobs directory then
Click on "reload the configuration from disk" on new jenkins server console -->go to "Manage jenkins " --> click one "reload the configuration from disk"
then you can see the jobs that you copied one in new jenkin server
2:using "Jobs import plugin " -need to install this plugin on new jenkin server then should be enabled firewal of existing jenkins and new jenkins server
then we can do import the multiple jobs at a time from New jenkinw server console by clicking on "Jobs import plugin" option"
3:Using Jenkins CLI option from new jenkins server

&How to retrieve Jenkins password?&
Stop the Jenkins service.
Open the config.xml with a text editor (i.e notepad++), maybe be in C:\jenkins\config.xml (could backup it also).
Find this <useSecurity>true</useSecurity> and change it to <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
Start Jenkins service.

hat is Jenkins Pipeline?
In Jenkins, a pipeline is a group of events or jobs which are interlinked with one another in a sequence.

In simple words, Jenkins Pipeline is a combination of plugins that support the integration and implementation 
of continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins. A pipeline has an extensible automation server 
for creating simple or complex delivery pipelines "as code," via pipeline DSL (Domain-specific Language).

^^^^^^^How to setup Build Pipeline in Jenkins job flow ^^^^^^^^^
First install "Build pipeline plugin"

then create a three jobs :
1)BuildJOb
2)TestJob
3)DeployJob
Under --> All+ --> just click on "+" then you can see "Build Pipeline View"

a)—Under “Build Pipeline View” option give job name as “MyBuildFlowPipeline-Jobs”
Then select initial job “Buildjob”
And save ,see the output
Note: Options can be kept default options

B)select again “No Of Displayed Builds” give "5" and save ,see output

C)Under “BuildPipeline” screen just click on “run“ option and observer scree build flow only after other deploying .

D) under Console Output Link Style” see option 1-LightBox, 2-newWindow ,3-This window. ,,,observer scree outputs windows each

E) observer click on “Re-Run “ options

--------------- How to setup "Delivery Pipeline" flow jobs -------------

Once this is done do it for same above three jobs using "Delivery Pipeline"
--Install pipeline then select All+ --click on "+" option and give the name of "Delivery Pipeline"
